# Week 3: Arrays, ArrayLists, and Vectors

This week covers Java's fundamental collection types: Arrays, ArrayLists, and Vectors. You'll learn when to use each, their differences, and how to work with them effectively.

## Structure

- **Notes**: Comprehensive handouts covering all three collection types
- **Basic Assignments**: Practice exercises for Arrays, ArrayLists, and Vectors
- **Advanced Assignments**: Exercises incorporating generics
- **Homework**: Two in-depth assignments with generics integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. **Arrays**
   - Declare and initialize arrays
   - Access and modify array elements
   - Understand fixed-size limitations
   - Work with primitive and object arrays

2. **ArrayLists**
   - Create and manipulate ArrayLists
   - Use ArrayList methods (add, remove, get, set, size)
   - Understand dynamic sizing
   - Use ArrayLists with generics

3. **Vectors**
   - Create and manipulate Vectors
   - Understand thread-safety and synchronization
   - Compare Vectors with ArrayLists
   - Know when to use Vectors vs ArrayLists

4. **Generics Integration**
   - Use generics with ArrayLists and Vectors
   - Create generic collection methods
   - Understand type safety benefits

## Prerequisites

- Java basics (variables, methods, classes)
- Understanding of loops and conditionals
